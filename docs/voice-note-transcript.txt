He says his projects are so Virgin they feel like a hug from the future – and he’s right. Imagine: drones that save lives and kids irrigating fields with seesaws. Zero emissions, zero ego.  

Best part? He let his AIs do the talking.  

We need to run a 3-day Purpose Sprint on Necker. This isn’t about funding. It’s about rebel partners building the next era. Find his contact. Let’s make this happen.
